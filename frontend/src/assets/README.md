# Assets Directory

This directory is for storing your static assets like images, icons, and fonts.

## Structure
- `/images`: High-quality photos, illustrations, and backgrounds.
- `/icons`: SVG icons and symbols.

## Tips for Premium Visuals
- Use **SVG** for icons whenever possible for perfect scaling.
- Use **WebP** or **Optimized PNG/JPG** for images to ensure fast loading without losing quality.
- Consistency is key: try to use icons from the same set (e.g., Feather Icons, Heroicons).
